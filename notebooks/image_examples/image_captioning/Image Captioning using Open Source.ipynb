    "# Explaining Image Captioning (Image to Text) using Open Source Image Captioning Model and Partition Explainer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use SHAP for explaining output of image captioning models i.e. given an image, model outputs a caption for the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are using a pre-trained open source model from https://github.com/ruotianluo/ImageCaptioning.pytorch to get image captions. All pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ruotianluo/ImageCaptioning.pytorch/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md. Particularly, this notebook uses the model trained with ResNet101 features linked under \"FC+new_self_critical\" model & metrics https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OsB_jLDorJnzKz6xsOfk1n493P3hwOP0."

    "### Limitations \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To explain image captions, we are segmenting images along axes (i.e. super pixels/partitions of halves, quarters, eights...); An alternate approach/future improvement could be to semantically segment images instead of axis-aligned partitioning and produce SHAP explanations using segments, instead of super pixels. https://github.com/shap/shap/issues/1738 \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We are using transformer language model (ex. distilbart) to do alignment scoring between given image and masked image captions, assuming an external model is a good surrogate for the original captioning model's language head. By using the captioning model's own language head, we could eliminate this assumption and remove the dependency. (ex. refer to text2text notebook examples). For more details, refer to the \"Load language model and tokenizer\" section below. https://github.com/shap/shap/issues/1739 \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The more evaluations used to generate explanations, longer it takes for SHAP to run. But, increasing the number of evaluations increases the granularity of the explanations (300-500 evaluations often produce detailed maps, but fewer or more are also often reasonable). Refer to \"Create an explainer object using wrapped model and image masker\" section below for more details."

    "    1. \"model-best.pth\": download from here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OsB_jLDorJnzKz6xsOfk1n493P3hwOP0  and place in the cloned directory.\n",

    "    3. \"resnet101\": download from here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7fNdx_jAqhtbVYzOURMdDNHSGM and place in the cloned directory under 'data/imagenet_weights' folder. Create 'imagenet_weights' folder under 'data' directory if it doesn't exist. \n",

    "\n",
    "5. Restart and clear kernel output to run this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Optional*: After running cells below in \"Load sample data\" section which loads sample data and creates a './test_images/' folder, try \"python tools/eval.py --model model-best.pth --infos_path infos_fc_nsc-best.pkl --image_folder test_images --num_images 10\" command in a terminal to verify that the installation was succesful. If it fails, please install any missing packages. ex. if 'lmdbdict' package is missing, try installing using \"pip install git+https://github.com/ruotianluo/lmdbdict.git\". If captions are shown in terminal output, then the installation was successful. \n",
