    "# `Exact` explainer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks demonstrates how to use the Exact explainer on some simple datasets. The Exact explainer is model-agnostic, so it can compute Shapley values and Owen values exactly (without approximation) for any model. However, since it completely enumerates the space of masking patterns it has $O(2^M)$ complexity for Shapley values and $O(M^2)$ complexity for Owen values on a balanced clustering tree for M input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the exact explainer knows that it is fully enumerating the masking space it can use optimizations that are not possible with random sampling based approaches, such as using a [grey code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) ordering to minimize the number of inputs that change between successive masking patterns, and so potentially reduce the number of times the model needs to be called."

    "## Tabular data with partition (Owen value) masking\n",
    "\n",
    "While Shapley values result from treating each feature independently of the other features, it is often useful to enforce a structure on the model inputs. Enforcing such a structure produces a structure game (i.e. a game with rules about valid input feature coalitions), and when that structure is a nest set of feature grouping we get the Owen values as a recursive application of Shapley values to the group. In SHAP, we take the partitioning to the limit and build a binary herarchial clustering tree to represent the structure of the data. This structure could be chosen in many ways, but for tabular data it is often helpful to build the structure from the redundancy of information between the input features about the output label. This is what we do below:"
