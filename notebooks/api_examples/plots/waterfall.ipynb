    "It is interesting that having a capital gain of \\\\$2,174 dramatically reduces this person's predicted probability of making over \\\\$50k annually. Since `waterfall` plots only show a single sample worth of data, we can't see the impact of changing capital gain. To see this we can use a `scatter` plot, which shows how low values for captial gain are a more negative predictor of income that no captial gain at all. Why this happens would require a deeper dive into the data, and should also involve training a model more carefully and with bootstrap resamples to quantify any uncertainty in the model building process."
