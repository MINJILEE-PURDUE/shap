Nonlinear interactions between groups of tokens are often saved and can be used during the plotting process.

When the `.hierarchical_values` attribute is present it also means that the explainer may not have completely enumerated all possible token perturbations and so has treated chunks of the text as essentially a single unit. This happens since we often want to explain a text model while evaluating it fewer times than the numbers of tokens in the document. Whenever a region of the input text is not split by the explainer, it is show by the text plot as a single unit.\n",

    "While plotting several instance-level explanations using the text plot can be very informative, sometime you want global summaries of the impact of tokens over the a large set of instances. See the [Explanation object]() documentation for more details, but you can easily summarize the importance of tokens in a dataset by collapsing a multi-row explanation object over all it's rows (in this case by summing). Doing this treats every text input token type as a feature, so the collapsed Explanation object will have as many columns as there were unique tokens in the orignal multi-row explanation object. If there are hierarchical values present in the Explanation object then any large groups are divided up and each token in the gruop is given an equal share of the overall group importance value."
