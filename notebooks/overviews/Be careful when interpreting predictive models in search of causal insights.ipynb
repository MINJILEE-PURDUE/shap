    "Predictive machine learning models like XGBoost become even more powerful when paired with interpretability tools like SHAP. These tools identify the most informative relationships between the input features and the predicted outcome, which is useful for explaining what the model is doing, getting stakeholder buy-in, and diagnosing potential problems. It is tempting to take this analysis one step further and assume that interpretation tools can also identify what features decision makers should manipulate if they want to change outcomes in the future. However, **in this article, we discuss how using predictive models to guide this kind of policy choice can often be misleading.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason relates to the fundamental difference between *correlation* and *causation*. SHAP makes transparent the correlations picked up by predictive ML models. But making correlations transparent does not make them causal! All predictive models implicitly assume that everyone will keep behaving the same way in the future, and therefore correlation patterns will stay constant. To understand what happens if someone starts behaving differently, we need to build causal models, which requires making assumptions and using the tools of causal analysis."

In that use case, it is no longer sufficient to identify a stable correlation between variables; this team wants to know whether manipulating feature `X` will cause a change in `Y`.

Even though Ad Spend has no direct causal effect on retention, it is correlated with the Last Upgrade and Monthly Usage features, which do drive retention. Our predictive model identifies Ad Spend as the one of the best single predictors of retention because it captures so many of the true causal drivers through correlations. XGBoost imposes regularization, which is a fancy way of saying that it tries to choose the simplest possible model that still predicts well. If it could predict equally well using one feature rather than three, it will tend to do that to avoid overfitting. But this means that if Ad Spend is highly correlated with both Last Upgrade and Monthly Usage, XGBoost may use Ad Spend instead of the causal features! This property of XGBoost (or any other machine learning model with regularization) is very useful for generating robust predictions of future retention, but not good for understanding which features we should manipulate if we want to increase retention.\n",

    "This highlights the importance of matching the right modeling tools to each question. Unlike the bug reporting example, there is nothing intuitively wrong with the conclusion that increasing ad spend increases retention. Without proper attention to what our predictive model is, and is not, measuring, we could easily have proceeded with this finding and only learned our mistake after increasing spending on advertising and not getting the renewal results we expected.\n",

    "### Observational Causal Inference\n",
    "The good news for Ad Spend is that we can measure all the features that could confound it (those features with arrows into Ad Spend in our causal graph above). Therefore, this is an example of observed confounding, and we should be able to disentangle the correlation patterns using only the data we've already collected; we just need to use the right tools from observational causal inference. These tools allow us to specify what features could confound Ad Spend and then adjust for those features, to get an **unconfounded** estimate of the causal effect of Ad Spend on product renewal.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particularly flexible tool for observational causal inference is double/debiased machine learning. It uses any machine learning model you want to first deconfound the feature of interest (i.e. Ad Spend) and then estimate the average causal effect of changing that feature (i.e. the average slope of the causal effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "Double ML works as follows:\n",
    "1. Train a model to predict a feature of interest (i.e. Ad Spend) using a set of possible confounders (i.e. any features not caused by Ad Spend).\n",
    "2. Train a model to predict the outcome (i.e. Did Renew) using the same set of possible confounders.\n",
    "3. Train a model to predict the residual variation of the outcome (the variation left after subtracting our prediction) using the residual variation of the causal feature of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that if Ad Spend causes renewal, then the part of Ad Spend that can't be predicted by other confounding features should be correlated with the part of renewal that can't be predicted by other confounding features. Stated another way, double ML assumes that there is an independent (unobserved) noise feature that impacts Ad Spend (since Ad Spend is not perfectly determined by the other features), so we can impute the value of this independent noise feature and then train a model on this independent feature to predict the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could do all the double ML steps manually, it is easier to use a causal inference package like econML or CausalML. Here we use econML's LinearDML model. This returns a P-value of whether that treatment has a non-zero a causal effect, and works beautifully in our scenario, correctly identifying that there is no evidence for a causal effect of ad spending on renewal (P-value = 0.85):"

    "Non-confounding redundancy can be fixed in principle by removing the redundant variables from the model (see below). For example, if we removed Interactions from the model then we will capture the full effect of making a sales call on renewal probability. This removal is also important for double ML, since double ML will fail to capture indirect causal effects if you control for downstream features caused by the feature of interest. In this case double ML will only measure the \"direct\" effect that does not pass through the other feature. Double ML is however robust to controlling for upstream non-confounding redundancy (where the redundant feature causes the feature of interest), though this will reduce your statistical power to detect true effects.\n",

If it is because of confounding then we should control for that feature using a method like double ML, whereas if it is a downstream consequence then we should drop the feature from our model if we want full causal effects rather than only direct effects. Controlling for a feature we shouldn't tends to hide or split up causal effects, while failing to control for a feature we should have controlled for tends to infer causal effects that do not exist. This generally makes controlling for a feature the safer option when you are uncertain."

Difference-in-difference approaches can be helpful when the introduction of new treatments is staggered across groups.

    "\n",
    "Flexible predictive models like XGBoost or LightGBM are powerful tools for solving prediction problems. However, they are not inherently causal models, so interpreting them with SHAP will fail to accurately answer causal questions in many common situations. Unless features in a model are the result of experimental variation, applying SHAP to predictive models without considering confounding is generally not an appropriate tool to measure causal impacts used to inform policy. SHAP and other interpretability tools can be useful for causal inference, and SHAP is integrated into many causal inference packages, but those use cases are explicitly causal in nature. To that end, using the same data we would collect for prediction problems and using causal inference methods like double ML that are particularly designed to return causal effects is often a good approach for informing policy. In other situations, only an experiment or other source of randomization can really answer what if questions. Causal inference always requires us to make important assumptions. The main point of this article is that the assumptions we make by interpreting a normal predictive model as causal are often unrealistic."
