    "\n",
    "This is an introduction to explaining machine learning models with Shapley values. Shapley values are a widely used approach from cooperative game theory that come with desirable properties. This tutorial is designed to help build a solid understanding of how to compute and interpet Shapley-based explanations of machine learning models. We will take a practical hands-on approach, using the `shap` Python package to explain progressively more complex models. This is a living document, and serves as an introduction to the `shap` Python package. So if you have feedback or contributions please open an issue or pull request to make this tutorial better!\n",

If for example we were to measure the age of a home in minutes instead of years, then the coefficients for the HouseAge feature would become 0.0115 / (365∗24∗60) = 2.18e-8. Clearly the number of years since a house was built is not more important than the number of minutes, yet its coefficient value is much larger.

    "### Reading SHAP values from partial dependence plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind Shapley value based explanations of machine learning models is to use fair allocation results from cooperative game theory to allocate credit for a model's output $f(x)$ among its input features<!--[cite]-->. In order to connect game theory with machine learning models, it is necessary to both match a model's input features with players in a game, and also match the model function with the rules of the game. Since in game theory a player can join or not join a game, we need a way for a feature to \"join\" or \"not join\" a model. The most common way to define what it means for a feature to \"join\" a model is to say that feature has \"joined a model\" when we know the value of that feature, and it has not joined a model when we don't know the value of that feature. To evaluate an existing model $f$ when only a subset $S$ of features are part of the model we integrate out the other features using a conditional expected value formulation. This formulation can take two forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E[f(X) \\mid X_S = x_S]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>or</center> \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E[f(X) \\mid do(X_S = x_S)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first form we know the values of the features in S because we *observe* them. In the second form we know the values of the features in S because we *set* them. In general, the second form is usually preferable, both because it tells us how the model would behave if we were to intervene and change its inputs, and also because it is much easier to compute. <!--For a much more in depth discussion on the differences between these two formulations see the spearate article on [causal vs observational feature importances]() [TODO].--> In this tutorial we will focus entirely on the second formulation. We will also use the more specific term \"SHAP values\" to refer to Shapley values applied to a conditional expectation function of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP values can be very complicated to compute (they are NP-hard in general), but linear models are so simple that we can read the SHAP values right off a partial dependence plot. When we are explaining a prediction $f(x)$, the SHAP value for a specific feature $i$ is just the difference between the expected model output and the partial dependence plot at the feature's value $x_i$:"

For machine learning models this means that SHAP values of all the input features will always sum up to the difference between baseline (expected) model output and the current model output for the prediction being explained.
