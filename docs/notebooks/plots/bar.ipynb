    "## Using feature clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Often features in datasets are partially or fully redundant with each other. Where redudant means that a model could use either feature and still get same accuracy. To find these features practitioners will often compute correlation matrices among the features, or use some type of clustering method. When working with SHAP we recommend a more direct approach that measures feature redundancy through model loss comparisions. The `shap.utils.hclust` method can do this and build a hierarchical clustering of the feature by training XGBoost models to predict the outcome for each pair of input features. For typical tabular dataset this results in much more accurate measures of feature redundancy than you would get from unsupervised methods like correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we compute such a clustering we can then pass it to the bar plot so we can simultainously visualize both the feature redundancy structure and the feature importances. Note that by default we don't show all of the clustering structure, but only the parts of the clustering with distance < 0.5. Distance in the clustering is assumed to be scaled roughly between 0 and 1, where 0 distance means the features perfectly redundant and 1 means they are completely independent. In the plot below we see that only relationship and marital status have more that 50% redundany, so they are the only features grouped in the bar plot:"
